In your config file change these settings

{% highlight yaml %}
title: dbyll
Today I have installed the dbyll template as this looks good for simple regular posts.
Updated my google map/traffic pages so they now work with this template.
Menu is using the "road" icon from Font Awesome for the traffic pages
{% endhighlight %}
